# cloj-fin

A clojure project designed to help teach me how to use clojure as well as up my skills when
it comes to financial and stock analysis.

## Usage

This application should only be thought of as a proof of concept for how clojure can be used as
a tool for financial analysis of the stock market. I am in no way liable for anything that
happens from actually using this information.
